## Conclusion.
We talked about how to get RFM values from customer purchase data, and we made two kinds of segmentation with RFM quantiles and K-Means clustering methods. With this result, we can now figure out who are our ‘golden’ customers, the most profitable groups. This also tells us on which customer to focus on and to whom give special offers or promotions for fostering loyalty among customers. We can select the best communication channel for each segment and improve new marketing strategies.
